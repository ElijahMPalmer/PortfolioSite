This is a public display of my projects, a resource to find out more about me, and a daily log of what I have learned. 

## Technologies
This Project was created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JavaScript

## Learning
This project helped me learn how to structure and utilize a database using postgreSQL and ExpressJS so that I could store my blog posts. I also improved my overall HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by building this site from scratch. I also learned how to create an Authentication system using BCrypt to allow myself an Admin login feature, so that only I can add blog posts to my site.
